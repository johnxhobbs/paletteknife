\usage{
autolegend(...)
}
\description{
Add a legend for the last autocol() set generated
}

If no location (such as 'bottom') is given, then it calls the locator() crosshairs
so the position of the legend can be picked interactively.
}
\examples{
autolegend('topright', ncol = 2)
autolegend(horiz = T, bty = 'n') #Â Try clicking just under the plot title
}
