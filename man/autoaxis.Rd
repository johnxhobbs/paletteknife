\description{
Overlay base plot axis with custom intervals
}
\details{
Major and minor tick marks can be specified in a number of ways:
\itemize{
\item As a character string if the axis is datetime, such as 'year' or 'hour'
which are passed to seq().
\item As a tick interval using the default \code{spacing = TRUE}
\item As an approximate number of tick marks to include, using pretty() to find
the best interval, using \code{spacing = FALSE}
}

Major adds labels and ticks, minor is just half-sized ticks marks. Both
tick sizes can be changed (or direction changed) using \code{tck}.

Three different datetime axis are possible: year, day-offset, seconds-offset. Use
\code{format} to specify how the label should appear, such as '\%b \%Y' (see ?strptime)
\itemize{
\item Year should be treated as a conventional numeric axis, use major=1/12 not major='month'.
\item day-offset is an axis of class(x) = 'Date' and is identified if the axis range exists
within +/-9e4, or within dates 1723 - 2216.
\item second-offset is an axis of class(x)='POSIXct' and is identified by a range outside
of +/-9e4. This will give very strange results if your POSIXct axis is within
24 hours of 1970-01-01.
}

A grid can be added at the same time by setting major_grid or minor_grid to \code{TRUE}
or a colour. If \code{TRUE}, a transparent black is used by default.

Any other options can be passed through to axis() directly (see ?axis), most
notably \code{las = 2} to rotate the labels.
