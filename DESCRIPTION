Description: This function embeds a few of the most popular colour palettes (ColorBrewer, Viridis, Turbo, and others) 
             and wraps them in a simple colorRamp helper function to facilitate fast mapping of a variable to colour.
             The output can be used with the default plot() functions in-line, or as a static palette for image().
             Creating a palette creates a hidden legend object which can be plotted interactively with no further faff.
